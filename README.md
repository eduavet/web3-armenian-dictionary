## ✨ Why This Project Exists

Web3 terminology evolves rapidly, and many concepts:

- Have no widely accepted Armenian equivalent  
- Are translated inconsistently across sources  
- Are often left untranslated or written in “Armglish”  

The **Web3 Armenian Dictionary** exists to address these issues by offering a **community-driven**, **carefully curated**, and **linguistically responsible** reference that supports:

- 🎓 Students and learners  
- 🧑‍💻 Developers and engineers  
- 📈 Traders and Web3 enthusiasts  
- 📚 Educators and content creators  


## 📚 Dictionary Format

All terms are stored in a single file for simplicity and easy access:

- 📄 `dictionary.md`

Each entry follows this format:

| English Term | Armenian Translation(s) |
| :--- | :--- |
| smart contract | խելացի պայմանագիր |

### Formatting rules

- English terms are listed **alphabetically**
- Multiple Armenian translations are separated by commas
- **Web3 / technical meanings come first** when multiple meanings exist

- ➕ Adding new terms
