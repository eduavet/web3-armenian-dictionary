## ➕ How to Add a New Term

1. Open `dictionary.md`.
2. Find the correct alphabetical position (based on the English term).
3. Add the term using the following format:

| English Term | Armenian Translation(s) |
| :--- | :--- |
| smart contract | խելացի պայմանագիր |

1. Use **Eastern Armenian (Արևելահայերեն)** spelling.
2. Separate multiple translations with commas.

## ✏️ Improving Existing Translations  

If you believe a translation can be improved or corrected:

- Edit the existing entry in `dictionary.md`.
- Keep the original English term unchanged.
- Replace or refine the Armenian translation.
- In your Pull Request, briefly explain **why** the proposed translation is more accurate, clearer, or more commonly accepted.

If you are unsure, feel free to open an Issue for discussion before submitting a change.

## 📏 Rules & Guidelines

- **No duplicates**  
  Check that the English term does not already exist.

- **Accuracy**  
  Keep translations professional, precise, and neutral.

- **No slang**  
  Avoid *“Armglish”* (transliterated English) when a meaningful Armenian term exists.

- **Context first**  
  If a term has multiple meanings, the Web3 / technical meaning should come first.
